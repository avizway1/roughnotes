SonarQube : open-source platform for inspecting and analyzes code quality..

--> Easily integrate with CICD pipelines.. 

--> Bug
--> Vulnarability
--> Code Smell


Improve code quality : 
Security Assurance : 
Team Collaboration : 

Code Reliability : Bugs, logiocal error, incorrect code, potential risks
Code Security : XSS (Cross site scripting), SQL injection..
Code Coverage & Duplication : identify the code duplication percentage across modules
Metrics : Linues of.. commit rate.. Setup code standards..

--

Quality Gate : It acts as checkpoint (go or no go)..

Pass / Gree : COde is healthy, we are matching the org standards...
Fail / Red : Code has too many issues... shoultn't deployed..

Code Coverage >= 80% or more   --> We can treat it as a good code and continue with the deployment
Bugs or Vulnarability : 0
Code Duplication : <= 3%

-----

Code Smell : Warning signal in the code.. 
--> Any improvements required.. 
--> Poor Naming standards.... Hardcoading sensitive values.. Too many parameters.. Duplicate code.. Lot of code commented out..


Bug : issue, causes application broken..
Vulnarability : Security issue
Code smell : Bad Practices.. 



Projects : An application / piece of application..
issues : problems found in our code
Rules : The things we want to "check" when code is scanned by SQ.
Quality Polocies : Collection of Rules (Java / cloudformation..)
Quality Gates : Pass/Fail call for code based on code coverage..
